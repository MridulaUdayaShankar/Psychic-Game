# Project title: Psychic-Game
## Getting Started

This is a project to build an App that randomly picks a letter, and the user has to Guess which letter the app chose.


## Pre-requisites

Put the following text on your page:
* Guess what letter I'm thinking of
* Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
* Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
* Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
* Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses

#### When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again 
(without refreshing the page)
#### When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh 
(just like when the user wins)
